                Originally from Switzerland, I have grown up in the canton of
                Bern in a bilingual French-German setting. Early on I have been
                confronted with different linguistic systems and developed a
                passion for language learning. In 2017, I completed a Bachelor
                in General Linguistics at the University of Bern, and in 2019, I
                graduated from Stockholm University with a Master in Typology
                and Linguistic Diversity. Besides being fluent in in German,
                French, and English, I have also acquired proficiency in Swedish
                since moving to Stockholm in 2017. Moreover, I speak Spanish and
                some Mandarin Chinese. Currently, I am learning Farsi.

                Alongside my passion for human languages, I have developed a
                keen interest in computer languages and enjoy creating beautiful
                and functional applications. My journey into coding began while
                working as a linguist on the Data Science team at Gavagai.
                Writing SQL and Python programs to clean, parse, and update big
                data sets was an integral part of my job. Over time, I took on
                more programming projects, using SQL, Python, Git, and Docker
                daily to assist my colleagues with expanding and improving
                Gavagai's flagship product â€“ a review analysis system capable of
                processing customer feedback across more than 40 languages. In
                2022, I pursued a formal education in Computer Science with a
                focus on Web Development at the Blekinge Institute of
                Technology, aiming to become a certified full-stack developer
                and launch a career in tech.

              As a full-stack developer specializing in web technologies, I have
              contributed to both the backend and frontend of numerous web
              applications. Below is a selection of projects I have developed,
              either independently or in collaboration with a teammate.
